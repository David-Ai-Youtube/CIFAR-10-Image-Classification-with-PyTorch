# CIFAR-10-Image-Classification-with-PyTorch

This code implements a neural network using PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. 
The neural network is trained using stochastic gradient descent and cross-entropy loss, 
and the accuracy of the network is tested on a set of 10,000 images. The code includes loading and transforming the dataset, 
defining the neural network architecture, training the network, and testing its accuracy.
